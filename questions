    Values

"In learning about someone’s values, you are learning about their owner’s manual," Hendrix explains. Even seemingly mundane questions can get at a person’s values—like what’s motivating them to do well on a presentation or what they look for in an S.O.

"By learning about someone’s life philosophy, you're able to get at their true essence, how they live their life, and what drives their actions," Orbuch adds.

That said, you can't just ask, "What are your values." What you can ask:

121. What’s a relationship deal breaker for you?

122. If you had only one sense (hearing, touch, sight, etc.), which would you want?

123. What is your definition of success?

124. Are you at all religious or spiritual?

125. What are you most proud of in the last year?

126. What makes you feel most accomplished?

127. Who do you admire most in the world?

128. If you won a million dollars, what would you do with the money?

129. Which of your personality traits are you most proud of?

130. What’s the first thing you look for in a partner and/or friend?

    Dreams


"These questions get at what the person is motivated by," says Orbuch. "What gives them the strength to wake up every day and get going? What do they dream and think about in their day?" When you learn about someone’s dreams, you share something more intimate. Jumpstart a deep conversation by asking this:

151. If you could do anything, besides what you're doing now, what would you do?

152. What do you regret not doing in the last year?

153. What’s on your bucket list?

154. If you had unlimited money to start your own business, what would it be?

155. If you found out today was your last day on Earth, what would you do?

156. If you could live anywhere in the world, where would it be?

157. A genie gives you three wishes—what are they?

158. If you had the opportunity to be immortal, would you take it?

158. Which famous person in history would you want to spend the day with?

157. If you could time travel, when and where would you go?

158. Do you think you'll likely accomplish all your dreams?

159. If you could magically become famous, would you want to?

160. If you could relive one moment in your life, which would it be?

    Unconventional questions

Sometimes the oddball questions allow you to learn the most interesting things about a person. "Unusual questions allow you to see the varied, unique, and special qualities of a person—their answers give you personal information about what makes them tick," Orbuch says. "These questions also typically get the other person to think outside box and really ponder something." Ask these ~unconventional~ questions, and you'll definitely get some surprising answers:

161. If you see a puddle on the ground, do you walk around it or over it?

162. If you could have a super power, what would it be?

163. If you could go back to anytime in history, where would you go?

174. What’s the most unusual place you’ve fallen asleep?

175. At a party, where can someone find you?

    "Anytime you reveal personal information to someone else, it increases intimacy between you and the other person."

176. Do you wash your legs in the shower?
